The officer discussed with some of our committee members and residents about security issues. He recommended measures for residents to take to increase the security of the building.</p>
                        <p className={css.news_paragraph}>Residents are recommended to use stronger bike locks such as the typical D-shape bicycle lock. For above bonnet storage cages, residents are recommended to use a length of chain/padlock and wrap the chain through the bottom frame of the gate and bottom horizontal bar of the cage to reduce the opening area of the gates. Residents are encouraged to call 000 should they see anything suspicious or observe a non-resident enter the car park particularly on foot. It is also suggested that residents never leave valuables in vehicles and always lock their vehicles even whilst in the car park.</p>
                        <p className={css.news_paragraph}>He also made recommendations on security measures on the common property which have been passed to the Owners Corporation Committee to consider. Full report from this site visit is available upon request.</p>
